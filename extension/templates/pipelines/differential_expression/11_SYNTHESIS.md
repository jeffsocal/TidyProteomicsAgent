### Phase 11: Publication-Grade Scientific Manuscript Synthesis

In this phase, you (the LLM) will author a comprehensive, publication-grade scientific manuscript (`docs/manuscript.md`).

Target execution budget: **Strictly 5 turns max**.

---

#### Consolidated 5-Turn Execution Architecture

To achieve publication-grade scientific depth without exploding turn and token counts:
- **No Pre-Flight Reading Turns**: All empirical statistics, sample counts, candidate records, pathway enrichments, and figure paths have already been pre-compiled into `data/manuscript_digest.json`. Ingest `data/manuscript_digest.json` in Turn 1 and proceed directly to writing.
- **Single-Turn Block Authoring Rule**: Each turn authors an entire major section in a single consolidated operation. Do NOT fragment writing into micro-turns (e.g. do not take separate turns for 2.1, 2.2, 2.3).
- **Target Section Depths**: To ensure a publication-grade manuscript that naturally clears the >30 KB quality gate on Turn 4 without iterative padding:
  - Section 2 (Materials & Methods): ~800–1,000 words
  - Section 3 (Results): ~1,500–2,000 words (including formatted markdown tables)
  - Section 4 & 5 (Discussion & Conclusions): ~1,500–2,000 words (evaluating all 4 discussion figures, top candidates, literature concordance, and study limitations)
  - Section 1, Abstract & Front Matter: ~800–1,000 words (structured abstract ~250–350 words, 5–8 keywords, biological background)
  - Total manuscript: ~4,500–6,000 words (>30 KB).

| Turn | Focus | Section Title | Target Placement in Manuscript | Input Source Context |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Turn 1** | Methods | Materials and Methods: Experimental Design, Search & Stats | Section 2 (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) | `data/manuscript_digest.json`, `docs/experiment.md` |
| **Turn 2** | Results | Results: Overview & QC, DE Analysis, Pathways, Target Validation | Section 3 (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) | `data/manuscript_digest.json`, `docs/observations.md`, QC & DE plots |
| **Turn 3** | Discussion | Discussion & Conclusions | Section 4 & Section 5 | `data/manuscript_digest.json`, `docs/literature.md`, 4 discussion figures |
| **Turn 4** | Framing | Title, Header, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, References & Data Availability | Sections 1, 6, 7 & Front Matter | `data/manuscript_digest.json`, `docs/llm.md`, study citations |
| **Turn 5** | Verification | Checkpoint Gate & Phase Completion | Gate Verification | File existence, size (>30KB), zero placeholders |

> ⚠️ **Strict Formatting Rule**:
> Do NOT include internal numeric step labels or alpha codes in the final manuscript.

#### Zero-Exploration Direct Authoring Policy

- **Do NOT execute exploratory shell commands, R scripts, or directory listings**.
- All empirical data, quantitative statistics, top candidate metrics, and figure paths have already been compiled in:
  - `data/manuscript_digest.json` (compiled statistical digest and discussion figure paths)
  - `docs/observations.md` (primary data-derived observations & biomarker tables)
  - `docs/knowledge.md` (internal knowledge contextualization)
  - `docs/websearch.md` (second-layer web search findings)
  - `docs/literature.md` (third-layer DuckDB literature assertions & citations)
  - `docs/experiment.md` (study design, hypothesis, and sample groups)
- **Author `docs/manuscript.md` directly** using `write_file` (Turn 1 scaffold with Methods) and `replace_file_content` (Turns 2–4).

---

#### Master Template Scaffold (`docs/manuscript.md`)

In **Turn 1**, initialize `docs/manuscript.md` with the master scaffold containing designated insertion anchors, with Section 2 (Materials and Methods) already fully authored:

```markdown
<!-- SECTION: TITLE_AND_FRONT_MATTER -->

## 1. Introduction
<!-- SECTION: INTRODUCTION -->

## 2. Materials and Methods
### 2.1 Experimental Design
[Full text of 2.1 Experimental Design authored in Turn 1...]

### 2.2 Database Searching & Protein Quantification
[Full text of 2.2 Database Searching authored in Turn 1...]

### 2.3 Bioinformatics & Statistical Analysis
[Full text of 2.3 Bioinformatics & Statistical Analysis authored in Turn 1...]

## 3. Results
<!-- SECTION: RESULTS -->

## 4. Discussion
<!-- SECTION: DISCUSSION -->

## 5. Conclusions
<!-- SECTION: CONCLUSION -->

## 6. Documented References
<!-- SECTION: REFERENCES -->

## 7. Data & Artifact Availability
<!-- SECTION: DATA_AVAILABILITY -->
```

#### Turn-by-Turn Execution Schedule

Execute the synthesis strictly across the following 5 turns:

#### **Turn 1: Master Initialization & Complete Materials and Methods**
1. Read `data/manuscript_digest.json` to ingest study metadata, contrast, and sample counts.
2. In the same turn, write `docs/manuscript.md` via `write_file` containing the master scaffold and the **complete, fully authored Materials and Methods section** (~800–1,000 words total across 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3):
   - **2.1 Experimental Design**: Cohort structure, sample groups, biological model, and replication scheme ($n=3$) from `docs/experiment.md`.
   - **2.2 Database Searching & Protein Quantification**: Platform (`ProteomeDiscoverer`, `MaxQuant`, etc.), analyte (`proteins`), filtering ($\ge 2$ unique peptides, contaminant removal), and quantitation origin.
   - **2.3 Bioinformatics & Statistical Analysis**: Normalization benchmarking (selected normalization method and CV minimization), missing value imputation (reporting `imputation_method` from `data/manuscript_digest.json`—e.g., Random Forest `impute.randomforest` with `method = "matrix", group_by_sample = TRUE` for MAR missingness per Karpievitch et al., *BMC Bioinformatics* 2012, or column-wise minimum LOD `base::min, method = "column"` for MNAR/knockout designs, or complete-case bypass), empirical Bayes moderated $t$-test (`limma`, $|\log_2\text{FC}| \ge 1.0, q \le 0.05$), and Wilcoxon rank-sum pathway enrichment. Document feature retention metrics from `data/manuscript_digest.json` (`feature_retention`), formally defining the criteria under which features drop from linear modeling (e.g. search engine identification hits lacking quantitation across replicates vs all-or-nothing condition-exclusive dropouts).
   - *Guardrail*: Do NOT fragment into multiple turns for 2.1/2.2/2.3. Write all of Section 2 in `write_file`. Do NOT write Results, Discussion, or Abstract in Turn 1.

#### **Turn 2: Complete Results & Empirical Validation**
Populate the complete Section 3 Results via `replace_file_content` targeting `<!-- SECTION: RESULTS -->` (~1,500–2,000 words). When embedding figures, always use the exact filenames recorded in `figures` in `data/manuscript_digest.json` prefixed with `../` (e.g. if `figures$pca` is `"data/plot_proteins_loess_pca_PC1PC2.png"`, embed `![Multivariate Clustering PCA](../data/plot_proteins_loess_pca_PC1PC2.png)`; omit any optional figure whose path in `figures` is `null`):
1. **3.1 Overview & Quality Control**: Quantified entity counts (total quantified vs modeled in expression from `feature_retention`), dynamic range, missingness percentage, and feature retention breakdown (accounting for unmodeled entities: zero-quantification background hits vs condition-exclusive dropouts like control- or treatment-exclusive presence), and embed available QC figures from `figures` in `data/manuscript_digest.json`:
   - `![Identification Counts](../<figures$counts>)`
   - `![Feature Overlap](../<figures$venn>)` (if present in `figures$venn`)
   - `![Coefficient of Variation](../<figures$variation_cv>)` (if present in `figures$variation_cv`)
   - `![Multivariate Clustering PCA](../<figures$pca>)`
   - `![Abundance Correlation Heatmap](../<figures$heatmap>)` (if present in `figures$heatmap`)
2. **3.2 Differential Expression Analysis**: Total significant counts ($|\log_2\text{FC}| \ge 1.0, q \le 0.05$, broken into upregulated and downregulated). Embed `![Volcano Plot](../<figures$volcano>)` matching `figures$volcano` in `data/manuscript_digest.json`. Formatted markdown tables for Top 10 Upregulated and Top 10 Downregulated candidates (Rank, Identifier, Description, $\log_2\text{FC}$, $p$-value, $q$-value in scientific notation, `imputation_bias`, `candidate_reliability`, Function).
3. **3.3 Pathway, Functional Module & Network Analysis**: Multi-ontology enrichment summary (GO BP/CC/MF, Reactome, WikiPathways) AND/OR Phase 7 *de novo* functional modules (`domain == "de_novo_module"` in `top_pathways` / `data/de_novo_modules.tsv` when formal ontology annotations were absent or supplemented). Embed pathway plots if present in `figures$enrichment` (e.g. `![Pathway Enrichment](../<figures$enrichment>)`). Explicitly state leading driver genes (`driver_proteins` / `member_genes`, e.g. `VCP, OS9, SEL1L`), Wilcoxon rank-shift $p$/$q$-values, and note that positive (+) score = induced in treatment; negative (−) score = repressed.
4. **3.4 Functional & Biological Validation**: Quantitative breakdown of target perturbation / biomarker efficacy (Target Gene Symbol, UniProt, $\log_2\text{FC}$, fold change, $p$-value, $q$-value, imputation risk, % change) comparing directly with experimental expectations from `docs/experiment.md`.
- *Guardrail*: Replace `<!-- SECTION: RESULTS -->` in a single operation. Do NOT write Discussion or Abstract in Turn 2.

#### **Turn 3: Complete Discussion & Conclusions**
Populate Section 4 Discussion and Section 5 Conclusions via `replace_file_content` targeting `<!-- SECTION: DISCUSSION -->` and `<!-- SECTION: CONCLUSION -->` (~1,500–2,000 words):
1. **4. Discussion**:
   - **The 70/30 Evidentiary Rule**: At least 70% empirical data interpretation; at most 30% external literature contextualization.
   - **Mandatory Top-Candidate Accounting**: Address and mechanistically evaluate every candidate in the Top 5 Upregulated and Top 5 Downregulated tables.
   - **Actionable Synthesis: Biological Signatures, Role-Classified Targets & Translational Archetype (`actionable_synthesis` in `manuscript_digest.json`)**:
     - Explicitly frame the dataset's **Primary Actionable Archetype** (`primary_archetype` & `archetype_rationale`: e.g., whether the findings define a *Predictive Biomarker Panel*, a *Druggable Target / Synthetic Vulnerability*, a *Mechanistic Dependency*, or a *Model of Cellular Response & Adaptive Remodeling*).
     - Justify the biological programs displayed in `plot_discussion_dichotomy.png` using `signature_rationale` and the statistical rank-shift metrics from Phase 5 pathways or Phase 7 *de novo* functional modules (`data/de_novo_modules.tsv`), demonstrating why these genes form a coherent functional signature rather than an arbitrary fold-change slice.
     - Evaluate every prioritized candidate in `plot_discussion_candidates.png` (or `plot_discussion_literature_forest.png`) by its assigned **Actionable Role** (`Predictive Biomarker`, `Druggable Target`, `Mechanistic Dependency`, `Compensatory Buffer`), integrating its statistical reliability (`ROBUST_QUANTITATIVE` vs. `DETECTION_LIMITED_ON_OFF`) and mechanistic rationale.
   - **Mandatory Discussion Figure Embedding**: Embed and evaluate all discussion figures from `discussion_figures` in `data/manuscript_digest.json`:
     - `![Focused Biological Module](../data/plot_discussion_module.png)`
     - `![Opposing Biological Programs](../data/plot_discussion_dichotomy.png)`
     - `![Candidate Targets Forest Plot](../data/plot_discussion_candidates.png)` (or `![Literature Validation Forest Plot](../data/plot_discussion_literature_forest.png)` if `literature_status` was `"ACTIVE"`)
     - `![Imputation Diagnostic Strip Plot](../data/plot_discussion_imputation_diagnostic.png)`
   - **Literature Integration & Sub-Threshold Dynamics**:
     - If `literature_status == "ACTIVE"`, integrate study IDs, DOIs, and grounded citations from `docs/literature.md` and `docs/websearch.md`.
     - If `literature_status == "SKIPPED"`, explicitly note that a local literature graph database was not configured for this organism/study; calibrate biological interpretation using web search findings and empirical data without fabricating literature concordance claims.
   - **Reconciliation with Experimental Hypothesis**: Point-by-point evaluation against `docs/experiment.md`.
   - **Limitations & Actionable "What To Do Next" Experimental Roadmap**:
     - Address sample size ($n=3$), residual missingness, LOD on/off candidate bias, and feature retention accounting (reconciling modeled vs unmodeled rows via `feature_retention` in `manuscript_digest.json`: noting search engine identification-only hits lacking quantitation and condition-exclusive dropouts).
     - Present the structured **3-Pillar "What To Do Next" Roadmap** from `actionable_synthesis$next_steps`:
       1. *Orthogonal Validation* (targeted PRM/SRM or immunoblot confirmation of `ROBUST_QUANTITATIVE` vs `DETECTION_LIMITED_ON_OFF` markers).
       2. *Mechanistic / Functional Perturbation* (genetic knockdown/overexpression, pharmacological inhibition, or metabolic rescue testing the lead `Druggable Target` or `Mechanistic Dependency`).
       3. *Translational / Model Expansion* (time-course kinetics, dose-response, or cohort stratification).
2. **5. Conclusions**: Concise summary of the primary proteomic hallmark, the overarching actionable model (`primary_archetype`), and the prioritized next experimental direction.
- *Guardrail*: Author both sections in full depth. Do NOT call `complete_phase` yet.

#### **Turn 4: Framing, Abstract, Title, Introduction & References**
Populate the framing and reference sections via `replace_file_content` (~800–1,000 words):
1. Replace `<!-- SECTION: TITLE_AND_FRONT_MATTER -->` with:
   - Descriptive publication title highlighting the perturbation, model, and primary discoveries.
   - Standard Document Header referencing `docs/llm.md`:
     ```markdown
     # Title
     
     Created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
     Author: PROVIDER | LLM-MODEL
     Agent: TidyProteomicsAgent vX.X.X
     Analysis Framework: tidyproteomics R package
     ```
   - **Abstract**: Comprehensive structured abstract (~250–350 words: Background, Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions) reflecting finalized empirical numbers.
   - **Keywords**: 5–8 MeSH and proteomics indexing keywords.
2. Replace `<!-- SECTION: INTRODUCTION -->` with:
   - **1. Introduction**: Biological context of the system/model, known physiological roles, and study rationale leading directly to the working hypothesis.
3. Replace `<!-- SECTION: REFERENCES -->` and `<!-- SECTION: DATA_AVAILABILITY -->` with:
   - **6. Documented References**: Complete bibliography compiling literature citations and study IDs across `docs/*`.
   - **7. Data & Artifact Availability**: Explicit relative markdown links to scripts in `code/`, logs in `logs/`, tables in `data/`, and generated figures (`../data/*.png`, `../data/plot_discussion_*.png`).

#### **Turn 5: Checkpoint Verification & Completion**
- [ ] Verify that `docs/manuscript.md` exists with non-zero size (>30KB).
- [ ] Verify that all `<!-- SECTION: ... -->` placeholder comments have been replaced with full narrative text (e.g. `! grep -q "SECTION:" docs/manuscript.md` or `grep -c "SECTION:" docs/manuscript.md || true` to avoid exit code 1 when 0 matches remain).
- [ ] Invoke `complete_phase(phaseName = "11_SYNTHESIS", summary = "Authored publication-grade manuscript in docs/manuscript.md following staged chronological execution (Methods -> Results -> Discussion -> Introduction -> Abstract) into canonical publication structure.")`.
